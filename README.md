Paraphrased.

      * 1. Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread •rew nigh,
which is called the Passover.

      * 2. And the Chief Priests and Scribes sought, how they
might kill him, for they feared the People.

      * 3. Then entred Satan into Judas, surnamed Iscariot,
being of the number of the Twelve.

      * 4. And he went his Way, and communed with the
Chief Priests and Captains, that he might betray
him unto them.

      * 5. And they were glad, and covenanted to give him
Money.

      * 6. And he promised, and sought Opportunity to betray
him unto them, in the Absence of the Multitude.

      * 7. Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread, when the
Passover must be killed.

      * 8. And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare
us the Passover, that we may eat.

      * 9. And they said unto him, Where wilt thou, that we
prepare?

      * 10. And he said unto them, Behold, when you are entred
into the City, there shall a Man meet you, bearing
a Pitcher of Water; follow him into the House,
where he enters in.

      * 11. And ye shall say to the good Man of the House, The
Master saith unto thee, Where is the Guest-Chamber,
where I shall eat the Passover with my Disciples?

      * 12. And she shall shew you a large Upper Room, furnished;
there make ready.

      * 13. And they went, and found as he had said to them,
and made ready the Passover.

      * 14. And when the Hour was come, he sate down, and
the Twelve Apostles with him.

      * 15. And he said unto them, With Desire I have desired
to eat this Passover, before I suffer.

      * 16. For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof,
until it be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.

      * 17. And he took the Cup, and gave Thanks, and said,
Take this, and divide it among your selves.

      * 18. For I say unto you, I will not drink of the Fruit of
the Vine, until the Kingdom of God shall come.

      * 19. And he took Bread, and gave Thanks, and brake it,
and gave unto them, saying, This is my Body, which
is given for you: This do in remembrance of me.

      * 20. Likewise also the Cup after Supper, saying, this
Cup, is the New Testament of my Blood, which is
shed for you.

      * 21. But behold the hand of him, that betrays me, is
with me on the Table.

      * 22. And truly the Son of Man goes, as it was determined;
but woe unto that Man, by whom he is betrayed!

      * 23. And they began to enquire among themselves, which
of them it was that should do this thing.

      * 24. And there was also a strife among them, which of
them should be accounted greatest.

      * 25. And he said unto them, the Kings of the Gentiles
exercise Lordship over them, and they that exercise
Authority upon them, are called Benefactors.

      * 26. But ye shall not be so; but he that is greatest among
you, let him be as the younger, and he that is chief,
as he that doth serve.

      * 27. For whether is greater, he that sitteth at Meat, or
he that serveth? Is not he, that sits at Meat? But
I am among you, as one that serveth.

      * 28. Ye are they, which have continued with me in my
Temptations.

      * 29. And I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my Father
hath appointed unto me.

      * 30. That you may Eat and drink at my Table in my
Kingdom, and sit on Thrones, Judging the Twelve
Tribes of Israel.

      * 31. And the Lord said Simon, Simon, Behold Satan
hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as
Wheat.

      * 32. But I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail
not.

      * 33. And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to goe
with thee both into Prison and to death.

      * 34. And he said, I tell thee Peter, the Cock shall not
Crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny, that
thou knowest me.

      * 35. And he said unto them, When I sent you without
purse, or scrip, or shoes, did you lack any thing?
They said, Nothing.

      * 36. Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a
Purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and
he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment and
buy one.

      * 37. For I say unto you, That this, that is written, must
yet be accomplish'd in me; And he was reckon'd
among the Transgressors; for the things concerning
me, have an end.

      * 38. And they said unto him, Lord, behold, here are
two Swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.

      * 39. And he came out, and went (as he was wont)
to the Mount of Olives: and his Disciples also followed
him.

      * 40. And when he was come to the place, he said to
them, Pray, lest ye enter into temptation.

      * 41. And he was withdrawn from them about a Stones-cast,
and kneeled down, and prayed.

      * 42. Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this
Cup from me, nevertheless not my Will, but thine
be done.

      * 43. And there appeared to him an Angel from Heaven,
strongth'ning him.

      * 44. And being in an Agony, he prayed more earnestly:
and his sweat was, as it were, great drops of Blood,
falling down to the ground.

      * 45. And when he rose up from Prayer, and was come
to his Disciples, he found them sleeping for Sorrow.

      * 46. And said unto them, Why sleep ye? Rise, and
pray, that ye enter not into Temptation.

      * 47. And while he yet spake, behold, a Multitude; and
he that was called Judas, one of the Twelve, went
before them, and drew near unto Jesus, to kiss him.

      * 48. But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou
the Son of Man with a Kiss?

      * 49. When they which were about him saw what would
follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with
the Sword?

      * 50. And one of them smote the Servant of the High
Priest, and cut off his Right Ear.

      * 51. And Jesus answered, and said, Suffer ye thus far.
And he touched his Ear, and healed him.

      * 52. Then Jesus said unto the Chief Priest, and Captains
of the Temple, and the Elders which were
come to him, Be ye come out as against a Thief,
with Swords and Staves!

      * 53. When I was daily with you in the Temple, you
stretched forth no hands against me; but this is your
hour, and the power of darkness.

      * 54. Then took they him, and led him, and brought him
unto the High Priest's House, and Peter follow'd
afar off.

      * 55. And when they had kindled a fire in the midst
of the Hall, and were set down together, Peter sate
among them.

      * 56. But a certain Maid beheld him, as he sate by the
Fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This
Man was also with him.

      * 57. And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him
not.

      * 58. And after a little while, another saw him, and
said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man,
I am not.

      * 59. And about the space of one hour after, another confidently
affirmed, saying, Of a truth, this fellow also
was with him, for he is a Galilean.

      * 60. And Peter said, Man, I know not what
thou sayest: And immediately while he spake; the
Cock crew.

      * 61. And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter, and
Peter remembred the Word of the Lord, how he
had said unto him, before the Cock crow, thou
shalt deny me thrice.

      * 62. And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.

      * 63. And the Men that held Jesus, mocked him, and
smote him.

      * 64. And when they had blindfolded him, they stroke
him on the Face, and asked him, saying, Prophesie
who is it that smote thee.

      * 65. And many other things blasphemously they spake
against him.

      * 66. And as soon as it was Day, the Elders of the People,
and the Chief Priests, and the Scribes, came
together, and led him into their Council.

      * 67. Saying, Art thou the Christ? Tell us: And he
said unto them, If I tell you, you will not believe.

      * 68. And if I also ask you, you will not answer me,
nor let me go.

      * 69. Hereafter shall the Son of Man sit on the Right
Hand of the Power of God.

      * 70. Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God?
And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.

      * 71. And they said, What need we any farther Witness?
For we our selves have heard it of his own
Mouth.

    _ The XXIII Chapter of St. Luke's Gospel
Paraphrased.

      * 1. And the whole Multitude of them arose, and led
him to Pilate.

      * 2. And they began to accuse him, saying, we found
this Fellow perverting the Nation, and forbidding
to give Tribute to Caesar; saying, That he himself
is Christ, a King.

      * 3. And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the
Jews? And he answered him, and said, Thou
sayest it.

      * 4. Then said Pilate to the Chief Priests, and to the
People, I find no fault in this Man.

      * 5. And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth
up the People; teaching throughout all Jury; beginning
from Galilee, to this place.

      * 6. When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked, whether
the Man were a Galilean?

      * 7. And as soon as he knew that he belonged to Herod's
Jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself
was also at Jerusalem at that time.

      * 8. And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding
glad; for he was desirous to see him of a long Season,
because he had heard many things of him, and
he hoped to have seen some Miracle done by him.

      * 9. Then he questioned with him in many Words; but
but he answered him nothing.

      * 10. And the Chief Priests and Scribes stood, and vehemently
accused him.

      * 11. And Herod, with his Men of War, set him at
nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous
Robe, and sent him again to Pilate.

      * 12. And the same Day Pilate and Herod were made
Friends together; for before they were at Enmity between
themselves.

      * 13. And Pilate, when he had called together the Chief
Priests, and the Rulers, and the People,

      * 14. Said unto them, Ye have brought this Man unto
me, as one that perverts the People: And behold,
I have examined him before you, and have found
no fault in this Man, touching those things whereof
ye accuse him.

      * 15. No, nor yet Herod; for I sent you to him, and
lo, nothing worthy of Death is done of him.

      * 16. I will therefore chastise him, and release him.

      * 17. For of necessity he must release one unto them at
the Feast.

      * 18. And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with
this Man, and release unto us Barabbas.

      * 19. Who for a certain Sedition made in the City, and
for Murther, was cast in Prison.

      * 20. Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake
again to them.

      * 21. But they cried, saying, Crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * 22. And he said unto them the third time, Why,
what Evil hath he done? I have found no Cause
of Death in him. I will therefore chastise him,
and let him go.

      * 23. And they were instant with loud Voices, requiring
that he might be crucified; and the Voices of them
and the Chief Priests prevailed.

      * 24. And Pilate gave Sentence, that it should be as
they required.

      * 25. And he released unto them him who for Sedition
and Murther was cast into Prison, whom they had
desired; but he delivered Jesus to their Will.

      * 26. And as they led him away, they laid hold upon
one Simon a Cyrenian, coming out of the Country,
and on him they laid the Cross, that he might
bear it after Jesus.

      * 27. And there follow'd him a great company of People,
and of Women, which also bewailed and lamented
him.

      * 28. But Jesus turning unto them, said; Daughters of
Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for your selves,
and for your Children.

      * 29. For behold, the days are coming, in the which they
shall say: Blessed are the barren, and the Wombs
that never bare, and the Paps which never gave
suck.

      * 30. Then shall they begin to say to the Mountains, fall
on us, and to the Hills, cover us.

      * 31. For if they do these things in a green tree, what
shall be done in the dry?

      * 32. And there were also two other Malefactors led
with him, to be put to death.

      * 33. And when they were come to the place, which is
call'd Calvary, there they crucified him, and the
Malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on
the left.

      * 34. Then said Jesus, Father forgive them, for they
know not what they do.

      * 34. And they parted his Garments, and cast Lots.

      * 35. And the People stood, beholding; and the Rulers
also, with them, derided him, saying, He saved
others: Let him save himself, if he be Christ, the
chosen of God.

      * 36. And the Soldiers also mocked him, coming to him,
and offering him Vinegar.

      * 37. And saying, If thou be the King of the Jews,
save thy self.

      * 38. And a Superscription also was written over him in
Letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, This is
the King of the Jews.

      * 39. And one of the Malefactors, which were hanged,
railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thy
self.

      * 40. But the other answering, rebuked him, saying,
Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same
Condemnation?

      * 41. And we, indeed, justly; for we receive the due
Reward of our Deeds: But this Man hath done nothing
amiss.

      * 42. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when
thou comest into thy Kingdom.

      * 43. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee,
To day thou shalt be with me in Paradise.

      * 44. And it was about the Sixth Hour, and there was a
Darkness over all the Earth, until the Ninth Hour.

      * 45. And the Sun was darken'd, and the Veil of the
Temple was rent in the midst.

      * 46. And when Jesus had cried with a loud Voice, he
said, Father, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit.
And having said thus, he gave up the Ghost.

      * 47. Now when the Centurion saw what was done, he
glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous
Man.

      * 48. And all the People that came together to that Sight,
beholding the things which were done, smote their
Breasts, and returned.

      * 49. And all his Acquaintance, and the Woman; that
followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding
these things.

      * 50. And behold, there was a Man, named Joseph, a
Councillor; and he was a good Man, and a just.

      * 51. The same had not consented to the Counsel and Deed
of them: He was of Arimathea, 4 City of the Jews;
who also himself waited for the Kingdom of God.

      * 52. This Man went unto Pilate, and begged the Body
of Jesus.

      * 53. And he took it down, and wrapped it in Linen,
and laid it in a Sepulchre that was hewn in Stone,
wherein never Man before was laid.

      * 54. And that Day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath
drew on.

      * 55. And the Women also, which came with him from
Galilee, followed after, and beheld the Sepulchre,
and how his Body was laid.

      * 56. And they returned and prepared Spices and Ointments,
and rested the Sabbath-day, according to the
Commandment.
